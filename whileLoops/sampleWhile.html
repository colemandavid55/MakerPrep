        while (condition ) {
          do something
        }


      Create a vaiable called understand and set it to true.
      Write an infinite loop BUT DO NOT EXECUTE IT



      Adjust our previous loop to be finite.


      Create a variable called bool and set its value to be true.
      Make the condition just the variable, as opposed to the === operator.
      Write a while loop that logs something the console, then sets bool to false.
