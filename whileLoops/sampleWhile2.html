    /*
    Create variable called teethBrushed and set it to true.
    Write a while that console.logs something if teethBrush is false,
    this while loop should also not be infite.


    Create two variables called readyToGo and transportation, and set them to true.
    Make a while loop that console.logs something if both readyToGo and transportation
    are BOTH true.
    How would you go about ending the while loop?



    Create a variable called count and give it the value zero.
    Make a while loop that console.logs something while the count is 
    less than or equal to 2.
